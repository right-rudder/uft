If you’ve been dreaming of becoming a pilot, you might be wondering how long it takes to go from your first flight lesson to earning your license. At **Universal Flight Training**, located at **Sarasota Bradenton International Airport (SRQ)**, we break it down step-by-step so you know what to expect and how to plan your path.

## Step 1: Discovery Flight – Your First Taste of Flying
Your journey starts with a **Discovery Flight**. This short, introductory lesson gives you a feel for flying and helps you decide if becoming a pilot is right for you. At **UFT**, you’ll fly over beautiful landmarks like the **Gulf Coast**, **Downtown Sarasota**, and **Siesta Key**. [Book your Discovery Flight](https://flyuft.com/discovery-flight/)

## Step 2: Private Pilot License (PPL) – 3 to 6 Months
The **Private Pilot License (PPL)** is your first official pilot certification. Most students finish in **3 to 6 months**, depending on how often they train. The FAA requires a minimum of **40 hours**, but national averages are closer to **60–70 hours**. At **Universal Flight Training**, we offer flexible scheduling and personalized instruction to help you progress at your own pace. [Learn more](https://flyuft.com/programs/private-pilot-course/)

## Step 3: Instrument Rating – Add 2 to 3 Months
After your PPL, many students move on to the **Instrument Rating (IR)**. This allows you to fly in more weather conditions and improves your safety and precision. Expect to spend another **2 to 3 months** earning your IR at **UFT** in **Sarasota, FL**. [Learn more](https://flyuft.com/programs/instrument-rating/)

## Step 4: Commercial Pilot License (CPL) – 6 to 12 Months
If you want to fly professionally, the **Commercial Pilot License (CPL)** is your next goal. It requires **250 total flight hours**, so students often combine time-building with their studies. Many complete their CPL in **6 to 12 months**. Our modern fleet of **Cessna and Piper aircraft** gives you the tools you need to meet FAA requirements and build valuable experience.

## Optional: Multi-Engine Rating and Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)
If you plan to become a career pilot or flight instructor, you may also pursue a **Multi-Engine Rating** and **CFI certificate**. These programs can be added in as little as a few additional weeks of training.

## Total Time: 1 to 2 Years for Career Pilots
