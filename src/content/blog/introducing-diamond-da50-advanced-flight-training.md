Universal Flight Training is proud to announce the newest addition to our fleet: the **2024 Diamond DA50**. This state-of-the-art aircraft represents a significant step forward in modern flight training, offering pilots an opportunity to train in a platform that combines advanced technology, refined performance, and exceptional comfort.

For pilots looking to sharpen their skills in a technically advanced aircraft, the Diamond DA50 sets a new standard.

## A Modern Aircraft for Modern Pilots

The Diamond DA50 is designed with the future of aviation in mind. Featuring a sleek composite airframe, advanced systems, and a spacious five-seat cabin, this aircraft delivers a premium training environment that goes well beyond traditional trainers.

Its outstanding visibility, smooth handling, and refined ergonomics help pilots stay comfortable and focused, making each flight both confidence-inspiring and highly effective from a training perspective.

## Advanced Avionics and Situational Awareness

One of the greatest advantages of training in the Diamond DA50 is its modern glass cockpit. Advanced avionics provide pilots with clear, intuitive access to navigation, engine data, and flight information, helping develop strong situational awareness and disciplined cockpit management.

Training in this environment allows pilots to:

- Build familiarity with modern avionics workflows
- Improve instrument scan and decision-making skills
- Prepare for complex and high-performance aircraft
- Transition more easily into advanced ratings and real-world flying scenarios

These skills are increasingly important as general aviation continues to move toward technologically advanced aircraft.

## Performance That Enhances Training

Powered by a 300-horsepower Continental Centurion 3.0 engine, the DA50 delivers smooth, reliable performance with excellent fuel efficiency. Its stable flight characteristics make it an ideal platform for proficiency training, cross-country flying, and advanced skill development.

Whether practicing precision maneuvers or gaining valuable cross-country experience, pilots benefit from an aircraft that responds predictably while still offering the performance expected of a modern touring airplane.

## Comfort, Confidence, and Capability

With seating for up to five, a luxury interior, and a quiet, refined cabin, the Diamond DA50 turns training flights into enjoyable, productive experiences. The aircraft’s thoughtful design reduces pilot fatigue and enhances focus, allowing students to get the most out of every lesson.

For pilots seeking the latest in aircraft technology with unmatched refinement and reliability, the DA50 delivers an experience that truly stands apart.

## A New Training Standard at Universal Flight Training
