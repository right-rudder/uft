**Ready to reignite your passion for flight? The AOPA Rusty Pilots program is making a stop at Sarasota/Bradenton International Airport (SRQ) this September, offering lapsed pilots the perfect opportunity to return to the skies.**

Life has a way of grounding even the most dedicated aviators. Career demands, family responsibilities, financial constraints, or simply the passage of time can keep pilots away from the cockpit for months or even years. If you're one of those pilots whose logbook has been gathering dust, the AOPA Rusty Pilots Seminar on Saturday, September 6th, 2025, could be your ticket back to the world of general aviation.

## What Makes This Program Special

The Rusty Pilots program isn't just another ground school—it's specifically designed for pilots who once held certificates but have been away from flying for an extended period. Hosted by Universal Flight Training at SRQ and instructed by AOPA Foundation Rusty Pilots Presenter Ron Timmermans, this three-and-a-half-hour seminar runs from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM EDT and focuses on the unique challenges facing returning pilots.

"Returning to the skies is not as difficult as most rusty pilots think," according to AOPA's program description. The organization has partnered with local flight training providers nationwide to create an environment that's both educational and welcoming for pilots ready to make their comeback.

## Breaking Down the Barriers

One of the biggest misconceptions among lapsed pilots is that getting back into aviation requires jumping through the same hoops as earning an initial certificate. The Rusty Pilots program addresses these concerns head-on:

**No FAA Checkride Required**: Unlike initial certification, returning to flight doesn't require passing a formal FAA practical exam. The path back is more straightforward than many pilots realize.

**Medical Certificate Flexibility**: Depending on your intended flying activities, you might not even need a traditional medical certificate. Sport pilot privileges and BasicMed have opened new pathways for pilots with medical concerns.

**Flight Review Credit**: Attendees receive two to three hours of ground instruction that counts toward their required flight review, making the return process both educational and practical.

## What You'll Learn

The seminar covers critical updates in aviation that may have occurred during your time away from flying. From regulatory changes and airspace modifications to new technologies and safety procedures, the program ensures you're current with the modern aviation environment. This isn't about starting from scratch—it's about building on the foundation you already have while filling in the gaps.

## Perfect Venue for Florida Pilots

Sarasota/Bradenton International Airport provides an ideal setting for the seminar. With a 9,500-foot runway and both 100LL and Jet A fuel available, SRQ accommodates aircraft of all sizes. The airport's professional environment, combined with Universal Flight Training's expertise, creates the perfect atmosphere for serious learning.

Located at 8140 15th St E in Sarasota, Universal Flight Training brings local knowledge and experience to the program, understanding the unique flying conditions and opportunities available to Florida-based pilots.

## WINGS Program Integration

The seminar offers an added bonus for safety-conscious pilots: WINGS credit through the FAA Safety Team program. To receive credit, participants should ensure their WINGS email address is updated in their FAASafety.gov account during registration. This integration demonstrates AOPA's commitment to ongoing pilot education and safety enhancement.

## Community and Connection

Perhaps one of the most valuable aspects of the Rusty Pilots program is the community element. You'll be joining fellow lapsed pilots who share similar experiences and concerns about returning to aviation. This peer support network often proves invaluable as participants navigate their return to flying.

The program acknowledges that getting back into aviation isn't just about regulatory requirements or technical knowledge—it's about rebuilding confidence and reconnecting with the aviation community that many rusty pilots once called home.

## Registration and Investment

The seminar is free for current AOPA members, making it an excellent value for those already part of the organization. Non-members can join AOPA for $89 and attend at no additional cost, or pay $89 (plus a 5% credit card processing fee) without joining. Given the value of the instruction and the potential savings on future training costs, this represents a smart investment in your aviation future.

Pre-registration is strongly encouraged, as these seminars typically fill up quickly. The popularity of the program speaks to both the quality of instruction and the significant number of pilots looking to return to aviation.

## Take the First Step

If your pilot certificate is current but your flying currency isn't, this seminar offers the perfect low-pressure environment to explore your options for returning to flight. Whether you're interested in recreational flying, considering advanced ratings, or thinking about aviation as a career change, the Rusty Pilots program provides the foundation you need to make informed decisions about your aviation future.

The dream of flight doesn't have to remain grounded. With the right support, current information, and community encouragement, returning to the cockpit is more achievable than you might think. Mark your calendar for September 6th and take the first step toward reclaiming your place in the sky.
