During my IRA knowledge exam, there was an unexpected county-wide internet outage. Jose allowed me to wait at the location until the internet was working again, and did everything in his power to help me take the test the same day it was scheduled. True class all around!",

Great aircraft options as well. Would recommend to anyone looking to learn how to fly or rent an aircraft.",

One of the few places that offers a ground school course for both PPL and IFR. Ramp has easy access to taxiways for quick departures so it doesn’t run up the hobbs on you while also allowing you to gain valuable communications experience. SRQ controllers are also very accommodating and know the tail numbers and work well with you for IFR training. Overall great experience and I highly recommend them.",
