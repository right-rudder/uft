        `
          Founded in 2010 by Jose, a retired Master Gunnery Sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps, Universal Flight Training (UFT) is an aviation school dedicated to providing high-quality, personalized flight training at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport (SRQ). Jose’s vision of starting a flight school began in the late 80s when he earned his pilot’s license in Florida, but it was only after his final military deployment that he could bring this dream to life. Starting with just one aircraft and a small office, UFT has grown into a top choice for aspiring pilots in Sarasota and beyond, known for its student-centered approach and commitment to building lifelong connections with its graduates.<br>

          At UFT, we believe in tailoring our programs to meet the unique goals and needs of each student. Whether you’re a career-changer, young adult, or college student, we offer flexible, custom training paths that allow you to excel at your own pace. Our range of courses spans Private Pilot Licenses (PPL) to advanced certifications like Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) and Multi-Engine Instructor (MEI), with accelerated and fast-track options available for those eager to advance quickly.<br>

          With an impressive 98% checkride pass rate and over 500 graduates since our founding, UFT stands out for its experienced team of Certified Flight Instructors (CFIs) who collectively hold 30,000 flight hours. Our modern fleet of aircraft, including Cessna 172s, a PA-28 Archer, and a PA-44 with Garmin G1000, GNS430, and Avidyne systems, provides students with real-world experience on state-of-the-art equipment.<br>

          For those interested in scenic flights, we offer discovery flights over some of Florida’s most stunning sights, including Anna Maria Island, Skyway Bridge, and Siesta Key.<br>

          Join us at UFT and take the first step towards a rewarding aviation career, backed by experienced instructors, personalized training, and a supportive community.
